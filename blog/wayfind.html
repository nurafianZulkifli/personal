                    <p>The new Wayfinding system was first launched on the Thomson-East Coast Line stations. It spots a
                        new design
                        system, where the emphasis was mainly on iconographies, rather than pure texts. I for one, am
                        a huge fan of this new design. I love icons and pictorials as compared to texts.</p>

                    <br>
                    <hr>

                    <h2 class="mb-3" style="font-size: 35px; font-weight:bold ;">Observations</h2>
                    <p>It's paper signages galore!

                        When entering a TEL station, you will definitely be greeted with a portable stand holding up an
                        A4-size paper, mentioning either the lines, or the exit directories. At Woodlands TEL, there are
                        3 sets of escalators, one would bring you to the NSL, the middle ones would bring you to the Way
                        Out, and the third one, would bring you to Exits 5-7.
                        <br><br>
                        Many commuters would mistakenly take the
                        middle set of escalators, where it only brings you to the Way Out, and not to NSL, because that
                        is where the Faregates are. Hence signages like these (<u>Fig. 2</u>) were placed. While useful,
                        it
                        looks very clunky.
                        <br><br>
                        The worst one was seen at Marina Bay, where the portable signages, showing the NSL/CCL direction
                        and where they should alight to go to the different attractions.
                        (<u>Fig. 5</u>). I definitely think we can make this permanent, and have a more proper design.

                    <p>How can we improve it?
                        <br><br>
                        I understand that the whole intention of these new Wayfinding system is to make wayfinding,
                        well, easier. But how much simpler can these signs go?

                        As quoted by the designer himself, he said:
                    <blockquote
                        cite="https://www.lasalle.edu.sg/features/conversation-samuel-lim-redesigning-singapores-subway-signage">
                        “It means that our redesign, in this instance, has failed, because people can’t even see the
                        signage
                        hanging up there above,” said Lim, who works at the Land Transport Authority (LTA), a government
                        agency
                        that oversees the signage system of Singapore’s Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system."<br>

                    <p>He has since left that role. Uh-oh.</p>

                    <br>

                    <p>In my opinion, while it is true that it somehow failed, it's actually fixable.
                        Believe it or not, it just needed something. Yep, it's fine-tuning. To dive in deeper, let's
                        take a
                        look at
                        the different parts the new Wayfinding system did wrong.</p>

                    <br>

                    <p>Now, let's dissect the new Signage system into different components - Iconographies, Exit
                        Directories,
                        Consistencies, Overall Execution and finally, my proposed idea/fixes.</p>

                    <br>

                    <hr>

                    <!-- Part 1 -->
                    <div class="row row-blog">
                        <h2 class="mb-3" style="font-size: 35px; font-weight:bold;" id="icons"><u>Part 1:
                                Iconographies</u></h2>
                        <p>
                            Let's take a look at <u>Fig. 6</u>. The icons are straight-forward, and I applaud that. The
                            earlier
                            versions of the Line Caplets only saw it as TE, NS, EW etc, before being changed to include
                            the 'L' (i.e TEL, NSL, EWL).
                            <br><br>
                            One may argue "But what do these TEL, NSL short-forms mean?" Well, the MRT map itself has
                            legends, so people like the tourists will first look at that for reference,
                            so no issues with that. Also, it's crazy to include the whole name for a line with the
                            longest name - the Thomson-East Coast Line, for example, so the caplets would suffice.

                            people, like me initially, had no idea what these places are (<u>Fig. 8 & 9</u>).

                            However, the current implementation only has Exit Directories at the Concourse.

                            But before doing that, the Exit Directory list itself needs some minor tweaking too.</p>

                                Consistencies</u></h2>
                        <p>Consistencies are a key to a good design system. The current signage designs are almost
                            there, but
                            some parts are not consistent. A most notable example is the Exit Letters/Numbers. TEL uses
                            Numbers (Exit 1,2,3 etc), while the rest still uses Letters. Raffles Place particularly,
                            began
                            the changeout to the new current signage design, but retained the Exit Letters.
                            <br><br>
                            This may confuse some people, but I also understood as to why it was done. Changing it to
                            numbers - may
                            confuse existing people using the exits, by retaining the letters, it minimises confusion,
                            but at the
                            same time, lead to inconsistencies. In my opinion, they SHOULD change to numbers, and the
                            LTA should also
                            start consolidating exits to make it simpler.

                                break it into two sections, first is fixing the current implementation, second is how I
                                would redesign certain aspects of the signages.

                                My Wayfinding Philosophy is as follows:<br><b>Alight > Confirm > Exit</b><br>Hence,
                                information at the platform should include the Exit Directories, so immediately upon
                                alighting from the train, I would know where to go. So once I take the Escalator up, I'd
                                just tap out, and exit the stations.

                            <p>Reworked some of the icons (<u>Fig. 22</u>). For the way out, I've decided to use a
                                universal
                                way
                                out icon
                                (literally a guy on his way to an exit). For the Lift Icon, I've decided to replace the
                                elderly with a walking stick to a normal man standing icon. This is because there is a
                                separate 'Priority Use' sign which shows the different set of people who should be
                                prioritised to use the lift.</p>

                            <p>I have gathered several feedbacks on my own, and what often pops up among the other
                                requests
                                is the addition of Exit Directories at Platforms. You can see this evidently in TEL4
                                stations, with paper signages. Here, I've decided to
                                put it at an empty space (exactly where the paper signage were, in <u>Fig. 4</u>), where
                                it
                                corresponds to the Exits the Escalator sets would bring you to.</p>

                            <p>If you recall the rather crude Signage in <u>Fig. 5</u>, I've decided to make it a
                                permanent
                                signage. Added in the design cues from the Current Design Language, now it looks more
                                proper. The other poster is a redesign of what is currently being pasted at Jurong East
                                MRT,
                                but I've redesigned it in accordance to the current design, as well.</p>

                            <p>This is an extension of the fixes from <u>Fig. 19a</u>. Exits are clearly labelled in
                                Yellow,
                                with
                                prominent Exit Numbers, so commuters would be aware which exits would that set of

                        <p style="padding-bottom: 2em;"> As you can see, redesigns do not need to be drastic. I mean, a
                            major redesign has already
                            happened back in 2019, thus, it is absurd to introduce yet another design system. Hence i've
                            taken a different approach - an iterative redesign. <br><br>

                            I am also aware that any changes and additions require additional costs, hence I've come up
                            with a unique fix to an ongoing problem: paper signages! <a href="../blog/wayfind-2.html">If
                                you can't fix the problem of
                                paper signages cropping up everywhere, why not join them, but also make them better?</a>
